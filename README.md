# Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI Project)
Welcome to my Power BI project – an interactive sales performance dashboard designed for Blinkit – India’s Last Minute App. This project aims to showcase my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX, and storytelling through dynamic visualizations.

🔍 Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to analyze Blinkit’s sales data across different outlet types, sizes, and item categories. The dashboard helps business users gain actionable insights on sales trends, outlet performance, and customer preferences – all in an interactive and easy-to-use format.

📌 Total Sales: Overview of total revenue generated ($425K+)

🛒 Item Type Performance: Identifies top-selling categories like Fruits, Snacks, and Frozen Food

📈 Sales Trend by Establishment Year: Shows how outlet openings over the years impact sales

📍 Outlet Analysis: Compares performance based on:

1. Outlet Location (Tier 1/2/3)

2. Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High)

3. Outlet Type (Supermarkets, Grocery Stores)

🧈 Fat Content Breakdown: Sales comparison between low-fat and regular products

🌟 Rating and Visibility Metrics: Tracks customer feedback and product discoverability

🔄 Dynamic Filtering: Allows slicing data by outlet location type, outlet size, and item type for granular analysis



🧱 Tools & Techniques Used:
